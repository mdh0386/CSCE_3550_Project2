Declaration on the use of generative artificial intelligence

I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT-4 & 5, Free Version (https://chatgpt.com/overview)
to explain assignment instructions and technical content explanations.
Additionally, I primarily used it to generate code for this assignment.

List of prompts:
(Inside GitHub copilot)
 - I have an assignment for my cybersecurity class. This is the second project
and builds off of the first. Here are the first project's instructions:
"[project 1 instructions]." This project (the current repo), does all of this. Now,
take the following instructions for the next assignment, and tell me an
overview of what I need to do: "[project 2 instructions]"
 - Ok, now generate code that would accomplish all of this.
 - Stop, sorry. Remember that the project is currently all in rust. Use the files
from the project 2 repo and tell me what needs to be modified or new files to be created.
 - Ok, now generate code that would accomplish all of this and show me where to add it in
which files.
 - My Cargo.toml is this now: "[pasted file]" Where do I add: "[code]"
 - If src/main.rs is currently: "[pasted file]" Add this: "[code]" near
the top (and import the DB functions).
 - Why did you delete code instead of combining them?
 - I ran gradebot.exe project2 and got this error: "[error]"
 - I did cargo run and got this: "[error]"
 - Show where steps 6 and 7 would be in the main file
 - Now cargo run got this: "[error]"
 - Still errors. Fix please: "[error]"

(On chatgpt.com)
 - Here is code in my main.rs file: "[pasted file]". I am getting this
error when doing cargo run: "[error]" 
 - Still errors: "[error]"
 - [And so on of generate prompts and debugging prompts]
